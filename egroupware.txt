Install eGroupWare on CentOS 6.5

What is eGroupWare?
---

eGroupWare aims to be pretty much an all-in-one solution for collaboration in small and medium offices (and even small enterprise). It features calendar and email management, access control lists, a documenbt store, a wiki engine, a site builder, and much more.

What I found
---

Just following a basic install (and I had to refer to other, fairly old blogs to collate this info) doesn't seem to give a ready-to-go setup out fo the box. The interface looks clunky, but mostly intuitive at first, until you actually try to do some proper configuration. I still haven't found out how to set up user groups, the Wiki engine is... very bare bones, despite its WYSIWYG editor (and I see no way to create new wiki pages) and the super user doesn't have rights to view the built-in site area.

As I say, it needs more configuration than the documentation would have you think...

eGroupWare's installation "guide" is pretty sparse and not very clear as well. The guide talks about "EPL" but I think the community edition is non-EPL? Are there actual differences when it comes to installing?

Well, it's clear as mud. These notes are intended to clarify this.
